    "Overview of Modeling Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on the cleaned UCSD Amazon Software Reviews dataset (Ni et al., 2018), our main objective was to construct a predictive model capable of determining, at the moment a review is posted, whether it will ultimately receive more than five helpful votes. Because the “helpful” outcome is rare in the dataset and occurs long after posting, we restricted our features strictly to those available at posting time, including numeric attributes (rating, verification status, text length), review and product-level aggregates, and the review summary processed through TF-IDF and dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the chronological nature of reviews, we designed our workflow to mimic realistic deployment conditions: models train on earlier reviews and forecast outcomes for later ones. This time-based structure prevents information leakage and ensures our evaluation reflects how such a system would perform in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing and Feature Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare the data for modeling, we combined numerical and textual information in a unified preprocessing pipeline. Numerical variables were standardized to ensure comparability across features. Crucially, to address the instructor's feedback regarding predictive features, we engineered specific reviewer-level signals—such as reviewer_mean_vote and reviewer_mean_rating—computed strictly within the training window. This approach captures a user’s historical tendency to write helpful reviews without leaking future information into the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "For text processing, summary fields were vectorized using TF-IDF with unigram and bigram features, capped at the top 5,000 terms to limit noise. Because sparse TF-IDF matrices remain high-dimensional, we applied Truncated SVD to compress these text features into 100 principal components. This dimensionality reduction retained the most meaningful semantic variation while significantly improving model training speed and reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, because helpful reviews constitute only ~13% of the dataset (an 87:13 imbalance), we applied class weighting to proportionally increase the penalty for missing positive cases during training. Without this adjustment, models would simply converge to a trivial solution of predicting \"not helpful\" for every review to maximize raw accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Training Process\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented three candidate models using scikit-learn: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) as a non-parametric baseline, Logistic Regression for linear interpretability, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to capture potential non-linear interactions in the text data. Each model was wrapped in an identical pipeline, ensuring consistent preprocessing across all trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain temporal integrity, hyperparameter tuning was conducted via a rolling TimeSeriesSplit (4 folds). This ensured that every validation fold strictly followed its corresponding training window, mirroring a real-world forecasting scenario. For Logistic Regression, we tuned the inverse regularization strength C and applied the 'balanced' class weight parameter to heavily penalize the model for missing rare \"helpful\" reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Neural Network, we constrained the model to a lightweight architecture (two hidden layers: 64 and 32 units) and enabled early stopping. This was critical to prevent the model from overfitting to noise in the sparse text features, especially given the scarcity of positive cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because accuracy is uninformative in an 87:13 imbalanced dataset, our primary optimization metric was Average Precision (PR-AUC). Unlike ROC-AUC, which can be overly optimistic on imbalanced data, PR-AUC strictly penalizes false positives, making it the most honest metric for identifying the rare subset of helpful reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main Results and Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Among all tested models, Logistic Regression with class weighting produced the most stable and interpretable performance. On the held-out test window, the logistic model achieved a ROC-AUC of 0.80, indicating strong ranking ability. The ROC curve rose significantly above the 0.50 baseline, showing that the model consistently assigned higher probabilities to reviews that ultimately received more than five helpful votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as expected given the rarity of helpful reviews, the Precision–Recall performance was modest, with a PR-AUC near 0.13 (matching the baseline positive prevalence). At the chosen decision threshold of 0.475, the model achieved a Recall of 46%, meaning it successfully identified nearly half of all helpful reviews. The trade-off for this sensitivity was low Precision (0.13), indicating that while the model casts a wide net to catch helpful content, it inevitably flags a high number of false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threshold selection on the validation set improved F1 marginally, but the underlying class scarcity remained the dominant limiting factor. Together, the PR and ROC curves confirm that while the model is effective at ranking potential helpfulness (high ROC), the extreme 87:13 imbalance places a mathematical ceiling on Precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "These outcomes suggest that helpfulness is influenced by nuanced, context-dependent user behavior and remains only partially predictable using metadata and summary text alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, our modeling approach successfully identified patterns associated with review helpfulness, validating the hypothesis that combining reviewer history with text analysis yields predictive signal. Logistic Regression performed the best across evaluation metrics, demonstrating that simpler linear decision boundaries—when supported by robust feature engineering like TF-IDF and class weighting—can outperform complex architectures like Neural Networks on sparse, noisy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "While raw precision on the minority class is mathematically constrained by the 87:13 imbalance, the workflow provides a valuable ranking tool. With a ROC-AUC of 0.80 and a Recall of 46%, the system offers a transparent strategy for prioritizing high-quality content at the moment of posting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future extensions could improve precision by exploring pre-trained embeddings (e.g., BERT) to capture semantic nuance better than TF-IDF, or by employing ensemble methods (like Random Forest or XGBoost) to better handle the non-linear interactions that the linear model might miss. However, any future approach must continue to rigorously account for the \"time-travel\" constraints and extreme class imbalance inherent in this domain."

    "3.4.2 KNN \n",
    "\n",
    "The KNN model performed much worse than the logistic regression model and demonstrated limitations with this data. After tuning, the best configuration used was k=11 with distance weighting, and the threshold yielding the highest validation F1 was 0.35. The confusion matrices reveal that the KNN predicted the majority of the “not helpful” class, identifying only 11 true positives out of 67 actual helpful reviews in the rest set. The KNN test failed to generalize and offered limited practical utility for predicting helpful reviews. \n",
    " \n",
    "3.4.2 Logistic Regression \n",
    " \n",
    "The logistic regression with a regularization strength of C =0.1 and evaluated at the best validation threshold of 0.475, had the strongest and most stable performance among all tested models. The confusion matrices shows that the model identified 31 true positives but still missed many helpful reviews, which is common amongst imbalanced data. However, it did demonstrate strong generalization across time, and proved to be the most reliable. \n",
    "3.4.3 Neural Network (MLP)2\n",
    " \n",
    "The MLP was tuned with hidden layers of (64,32) and a regularization strength of alpha= 0.001, produced mixed results that was in between the performance of the KNN and logistic regression. The MLP showed that it can model more complex relationships within the summary text, but it does not generalize reliably. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "3.5 Error Analysis2 \n",
    "Across all three models, two consistent errors occurred. False negatives typically occurred on short or vague summaries that looked unhelpful at posting time but later accumulated helpful voted. Due to our features relying on the summary text, these reviews lacked enough signal for the models to classify them as helpful. In contrast, false positives were usually long or enthusiastic summaries that appeared helpful in wording but ultimately received little community engagement. These reviews often had stylistic markers that the model interpreted as helpful even though readers did not agree. The MLP overproduced these false positives due to its sensitivity in text patters while the logistic regression made fewer but more balanced errors. Overall, these patterns reflect the limitations of using the summary text alone. \n"
