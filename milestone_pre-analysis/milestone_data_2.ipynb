    "The objective of this project is to predict whether an Amazon product will review will receive more than 5 helpful votes at the time the review is posted. Our approach is to use a binary classifciation model using variables that are known at the time of the posting, so that our model is reflective of a realistic situation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the pvreious milestone, we had already cleaned and processed the data so that we could use it for analysis. We had removed variables such as \"image\" and \"style\" because they had too many missing variables which did not serve a good purpose for our model. All missing values in the \"vote\" column were turned into 0, which reflects a review that had received no helpful reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "To define the target variable, we had a binary threshold of greater than 5 votes. Reviews that got more than 5 votes were deemed as \"helpful\" while those that received less than 5 votes were deemed as \"not helpful\". Text features were processed into numerical representations which were better suited for modeling. Numerical variables  such as star rating and review length were scaled as needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Class imbalance were a major characteristic of the dataset, with the majority of the votes receiving less than 5 votes. To address this, we want to use class weighting to help mitigate the bias within the model from being too tipped one way. \n",

    "Model Overview and Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin with k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) as an intuitive baseline model. KNN makes predictions based on the most similar observations in the training data, allowing us to visualize how reviews with similar characteristics (e.g., length, rating, sentiment) tend to cluster together in terms of helpfulness. While simple and easy to implement, KNN can be sensitive to scale and computationally expensive for large datasets, so it will primarily serve as an introductory comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will implement Logistic Regression, which provides a probabilistic interpretation of helpfulness and offers clear insight into which predictors most influence the likelihood of receiving more than five votes. Because logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between features and log-odds of the outcome, it will help us establish a strong and interpretable benchmark for the project.\n",
    "We also plan to incorporate Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a dimensionality reduction step for our text-based and numeric features. PCA will help simplify high-dimensional representations (such as TF-IDF vectors from the review text) into a smaller number of components while retaining most of the variance. This approach can improve model efficiency and reduce the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to explore nonlinear relationships, we will test a simple Neural Network model. Neural networks can capture more complex feature interactions and patterns in the data—particularly from the text summaries—compared to linear models. However, due to the class imbalance and dataset size, we will keep the architecture small (e.g., one hidden layer) to balance interpretability and performance.\n",
    "Together, these models—KNN, logistic regression, PCA, and neural networks—reflect a progression from simple to more complex approaches covered in the course. This will allow us to compare models in terms of interpretability, computational efficiency, and predictive accuracy, and determine which approach most effectively predicts whether a review is likely to be deemed helpful."

    "Model Training Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "The training process will begin by dividing the data into training and testing sets, ensuring that the model is evaluated on reviews it has not seen before. A time-based split will be used so that the model trains on earlier reviews and tests on later ones, reflecting a realistic prediction scenario in which future data is unknown at training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "All numerical variables, including overall rating and review length, will be standardized to ensure that no single feature dominates the distance-based methods such as KNN. Text data from the summary field will be transformed into numerical features using a TF-IDF vectorization approach, which represents each word’s importance relative to its frequency across all reviews. This allows the model to capture key linguistic patterns that may be associated with higher helpfulness scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "After preprocessing, each model will be trained separately using the same training data to allow for direct comparison. For KNN, we will experiment with different values of k to identify the number of neighbors that yields the highest validation accuracy. For logistic regression, the regularization strength will be tuned to avoid overfitting while maintaining interpretability. When incorporating PCA, the number of principal components retained will be determined by the proportion of variance explained, typically around 90 to 95 percent. For the neural network, we will train a small feedforward model with one hidden layer and apply techniques such as early stopping to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the training process, cross-validation will be used to assess model performance and stability. Since the dataset is imbalanced, class weighting will be applied so that the minority class, representing helpful reviews, has a stronger influence during training. Model performance will be evaluated primarily using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, which together provide a balanced view of predictive ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of careful preprocessing, cross-validation, and class balancing will ensure that the final model is both fair and generalizable, providing insight into the factors that make a review more likely to be deemed helpful at the time it is posted."

    "Model Validation Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on the training procedure above, we validate the helpful (>5 votes) classifier with a chronological split to mirror deployment and avoid look-ahead bias. Reviews are ordered by timestamp and divided into Train (oldest ~70%), Validation (next ~15%), and Test (most recent ~15%); the test window remains locked until final scoring. All preprocessing such as imputation, scaling, TF-IDF, and optional TruncatedSVD is wrapped in a single scikit-learn pipeline fit only on the current training fold to prevent leakage. Within the training slice, we tune hyperparameters using a rolling TimeSeriesSplit, so every validation fold uses later data than its training portion. Because the positive class is minority, our primary metric is PR-AUC; we also report Brier score with a reliability curve to assess calibration. The classification threshold is chosen only on the validation window by maximizing F1 and then frozen before scoring the test set. To address imbalance during training, we use class_weight='balanced' and display the baseline precision (prevalence) alongside PR curves for context. Final test reporting includes PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, Brier score, the confusion matrix at the frozen threshold, and 95% confidence intervals via CV fold variability (or a blocked bootstrap by week if time permits). We also include brief drift checks  and a short error analysis of high-confidence false positives/negatives to ensure the chosen operating point is stable and interpretable."
